<p><b><font size="+2">INTRODUCTION</font></b></p>
<p>A microprocessor will not be of much use by itself. To perform useful work, it neeeds to be connected to other electronic components. To design a computer, a microprocessor must interface to main memory, a graphic subsystem, the keyboard,etc For the design of automation operation systems such as alternative energy system controllers, the microprocessor will need to be interfaced to a host of electromechanical devices and sensors eg cars. For the design of supercomputers, the microprocessors must be interfaced to bands of not just 10 or 20 but thousands of other microprocessors.</p>

The 8086 was the basis for all Intel microprocessors. It was a 16-bit microprocessor and represented a significant departure from the 8-bit devices. It owns 20 address lines allowing 220 internal locations to be accessed. The various versions of 8086 operated at a clock frequencies of 8 or 10 MHz. The 8088 is essentially an 8086 with a 16 bit internal data bus multiplied down to an 8 bit external data bus. It was depended to meet the demand for applications in simpler 8 bit systems
The 80186 was an 8086 with several support functions such as clock generator, system controller, interrupt controller and direct memory access integrated on the chip and increased clock frequency of 12 .5 MHz was added and the 5 MHz was available on the 8086 was dropped resulting in the selection of 8, 10 or 12.5 MHz.
